Chess AI Web Application
Overview
The Chess AI Web Application is a web-based chess game that allows a human player to play against an AI opponent. The application uses a Flask backend to manage game logic and a JavaScript frontend for user interaction and real-time board updates. The AI move is processed in the background using a dedicated game loop, ensuring seamless integration of player and AI moves.

Features
Interactive Chess Board:
The board is rendered dynamically on the client side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Real-Time Gameplay:
Player moves are immediately reflected on the board, and the AI responds automatically through a background game loop on the server.

AI Opponent:
The AI calculates its moves using a MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning (or similar logic) and processes moves asynchronously.

Game State Endpoints:
RESTful API endpoints are provided for retrieving the board state, making moves, and resetting the game.

Checkmate Detection:
The application includes logic to detect checkmate and end the game when no legal moves remain for a player.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Flask
(Other Python dependencies if any, e.g., for chess evaluation, etc.)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-ai-webapp.git
cd chess-ai-webapp
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Make sure to create a requirements.txt listing Flask and any other necessary packages.)

Usage
Run the Flask Server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The server will start and begin the background game loop for AI moves.

Open the Application in Your Browser: Navigate to http://localhost:5000 to load the chess board.

Playing the Game:

Click on a square to select a piece (only your own pieces can be selected).
Click on the destination square to make your move.
After your move, the AI move is processed automatically in the background and reflected on the board.
The board updates after each move, and game state is fetched via RESTful endpoints.
How It Works
Backend (app.py)
Game Loop:
A background thread continuously runs the main_game_loop() function, which checks if it is the AI’s turn and then calculates and executes the AI move.

Endpoints:

/state returns the current board state in JSON.
/move processes the player's move.
/get_ai_move (optional) provides the last AI move, used by the frontend to update the board.
/reset resets the board to the starting position.
Frontend (app.js)
Board Rendering:
The board is drawn dynamically by the drawBoard() function based on data from the /state endpoint.

User Interaction:
The player selects and moves pieces through click events handled by selectSquare().

Move Processing:
After a player's move is sent via the /move endpoint, the frontend starts polling the /get_ai_move endpoint to detect when the AI has made its move. Once detected, the board is updated accordingly.

Future Improvements
Enhanced AI Evaluation:
Integrate more sophisticated evaluation functions or machine learning models for improved AI play.

Real-Time Updates:
Consider using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events to push board state updates instead of polling.

Mobile Optimization:
Enhance the user interface for better mobile support.
